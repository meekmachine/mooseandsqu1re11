Note the following changes to needed to be made when running on localhost:

In the '/' folder there is a file, app.js.  In order to run eEVA locally you need to change the
Parse.serverURL variable to the string 'http://localhost:3013/parse' (note 3013 is the port number, you may be using a different
port to access this web application, please make sure that you use the port in which you are accessing eEVA from).  It should
look like the following:
    To Run Locally:                     Parse.serverURL = 'http://localhost:3013/parse';
    When running on the Affect server:  Parse.serverURL = 'https://virtualhealthcounseling.com/parse';

Although there is an affect version (http://affect.cs.fiu.edu:3013/parse), we should always use the https secure site for virtualhealthcounseling
Within the same file you will see that line 33 is commented out (note the line number maybe be different but the code
should be relatively close to that position, the line corresponds to the configuration of the ParseServer, in particular setting the path
to the cloud code).  You need to uncomment this line and comment line 32. It should look like
the following:

When running locally (i.e. on localhost):
33  //cloud: './eEvaParse/server/cloud/main.js',
34  cloud: './server/cloud/main.js',

When running on the Affect server:
33  cloud: './eEvaParse/server/cloud/main.js',
34  //cloud: './server/cloud/main.js',

In the '/client' directory there is a file, app.module.js.  In order to run eEVA locally you need to change the
Parse.serverURL variable to the string 'http://localhost:3013/parse' (note 3013 is the port number, you may be using a different
port to access this web application, please make sure that you use the port in which you are accessing eEVA from).  It should
look like the following:
    To Run Locally:                     Parse.serverURL = 'http://localhost:3013/parse';
    When running on the Affect server:  Parse.serverURL = 'https://virtualhealthcounseling.com/parse';
